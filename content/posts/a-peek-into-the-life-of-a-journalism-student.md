New Delhi: The past one and a half years have shaped me into the person I am today and they helped me find a great group of friends. There have been several instances when I was panic-stricken and resented my course for triggering me in the worst ways possible but I'm thankful for what I've learned thus far.



 I would not have met one of the most talented photographers who believed in me and my photography, assisted me in improving my talents, and taught me nearly everything I know if I had not chosen BAJMC over English honours.



 BAJMC gave me more than just a friend and mentor; it also gave me self-assurance. Even though I struggle with social anxiety, it taught me how to interview people. It taught me how to edit videos and how to blend my passion for lunar photography with my love of poetry to create photo essays. 



My course allowed me to capture  Harnaaz Sandhu's  (Miss Universe 2021) visit to our university but that wasn't the best part about her visit; the best part was the dry run, teamwork, and having a friend who trusted me to cover such a big event even though I had no prior portraiture expertise.



I've been tested by college life in both the nicest and worst ways imaginable, but it's been incredible to have friends that encourage me and help me overcome my fears.



 We encounter numerous challenges in life, and sometimes it's to seek support. It's beneficial to have a support system; someone to confide in because, on occasion, doing everything by ourselves isn't the best course of action as doing everything on our own becomes difficult and overwhelming.



At my previous college, I participated in debates (since one of my core courses was based on discussions, debates, and quizzes), shared my opinions with everyone in class, gave online and offline presentations, assisted my friend—the media club secretary at the time—in writing an event proposal, and photographed a number of events.



 Because I have the worst social anxiety ever and have always been the kind of girl who carries her books everywhere and her camera and hides behind them to avoid public speaking or social engagement, these were all the most horrifying things I've ever done but I’m proud of myself for challenging myself to face my fears and I have no regrets.



As a journalism and mass communication student, speaking to the camera or taking part in debates should come naturally to me. However, when I speak in front of a crowd, I feel like crying and I hyperventilate, which causes me to stutter, forget what I was saying, and make other mistakes. 



Thankfully, the universe was kind enough to provide me with the best friends I could ever hope for—those who embraced me when I couldn't be around others, sang to me when I couldn't sleep and reminded me to breathe during a debate.



College is a reality check; it's a step into the real world, not nearly as fascinating as everyone makes it out to be. We live in a bubble our entire lives, and the majority of the things we learned in school don't apply to college since we are taught different things in school rather than how to function in the real world. 



As important as the subjects we learn in school are, in my opinion, we should also learn how to transition from high school to college, and the rote learning system should be effectively forgotten.



 As a person with high-functioning anxiety, learning to adapt to college took a lot of time and even though I’ve gotten used to the pressure, It still doesn’t stop me from panicking about assignments and presentations.



A reality check on college life would be that we’re all busy most of the time working on assignments or doing internships or working on our extracurriculars and meeting up with friends is difficult when you’re in different colleges or when one of you has a job and as a college student you get frequent burnouts hence focussing on your mental health, taking breaks while working and doing things that bring you joy is essential.



Although everyone is encouraged to believe that college life is glamorous, it is actually difficult to adjust to and might occasionally make you homesick (regardless of whether you've always wanted to leave or not, there are some things at home that you miss when you live in a hostel).



Hostel life is exciting but challenging; sometimes you'll go for late-night walks with your friends, play with the campus dogs, stargaze and take pictures of the moon, have a sleepover with your friends, sneak your day scholar friends during your fresher's party, order pizza at 3 in the morning, and other times you might fight with your roommate, have frequent panic attacks, or refuse to be alone because you're afraid you won't be able to fall asleep because you're too anxious.



Although my first year of college wasn't easy, I was able to get through it because of my great support system. While college life can be challenging, it also offers incredible chances, such as joining the media club or the mental health club or making new friends who end up playing a significant role in your life.



 One of my favourite aspects of one of my current core courses is that the professor gives assignments but lets us pick the topics, giving me the flexibility to express myself freely and shed light on significant issues that are rarely discussed.



TIn conclusion, college life is challenging. It's not like school at all, yet it's still lovely. It's so emotional and raw. Finding your people in college and sticking with them is the best part of the experience.
