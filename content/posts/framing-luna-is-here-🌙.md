  A love letter to the dreamer in me. 

  Framing Luna has been in the pipeline for the longest time. What started as a mere photography account is now a full-fledged small business. When it finally came to life, it arrived at the most perfect moment, like moonlight slipping in through a half-open window.

Framing Luna has been in the pipeline for the longest time. What started as a mere photography account is now a full-fledged small business.

When it finally came to life, it arrived at the most perfect moment, like moonlight slipping in through a half-open window.

What began as a creative outlet has now grown into something rooted in everything I love: photography, memory-keeping, writing, and the moon.

Growing up, I collected postcards, scribbled little notes to my friends, and covered my walls in posters that felt like windows into my heart, gateways to the parts of me I didnâ€™t yet have words for.

\
Today, I get to create those very keepsakes: postcards and mini-posters crafted from my photography.\
It feels like a childhood dream gently unfolding into reality.

Two months ago, I decided to pour real intention into this, to turn my creative outlet into a brand.\
I spent hours talking to family members who guided me with love and wisdom. I challenged myself in new ways and stepped into roles I never imagined younger me could take on.

Framing Luna is not just a business. Itâ€™s a love letter to my younger self, my current self, my future self, and to you. Itâ€™s me gently offering my heart so you can share it with yourself or those you hold close.

Each piece I create holds fragments of me and echoes of the people I love and admire.

Whether itâ€™s a postcard adorned with a poem, a mini-poster blooming with flowers, or a quiet moment under the moon, thereâ€™s a little of everyone I carry with me in everything I make.

Framing Luna is storytelling through imagery.\
It is yours to hold, yours to frame, and yours to share.\
These pieces start with me, but once they reach you, they become yours.\
You continue the story from there, weaving your own moments, memories, and meanings into the frames.

***Framing Luna is a love letter â€”***

to the photographer in me,\
to the girl who collected paper memories,\
to the dreamer who still gets excited about decorating her walls.

To me, photography is visual poetry, a way to bottle up light, feelings, and fleeting moments.\
What started as a personal habit is now something I get to share: prints that can be gifted, framed, held close, or sent across the world with a note full of love.

I hope you come to love Framing Luna the way I do:Â  intricately, gently, and ardently.

With love,\
Aadya\
