New Delhi: Poetry is one of the most essential, powerful, and influential artistic mediums to exist. Poems are concise enough to grab attention on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, but long enough to gather large audiences in various cities. It has the potential to grasp and convey stories powerfully; it can act as a positive outlet and allow you to express your feelings beautifully.

You have the freedom to express your truth or tell your story as well. It can also change the way people communicate, encourage critical thinking, help us see the many hues of people, or even make us discover beauty in agony.

I always let my heart go wild when I sit down to write a poem. I enable myself to express whatever I'm feeling through my poetry and to tell my tale.

I try my best not to limit myself when I write, so occasionally I observe others and relay their experiences, or I just write about people or things that inspire me.

When I write a poem, I want it to have meaning for me; it should reflect some aspect of who I am and what I believe in. For as long as I can remember, poetry has served as a cathartic release for me. It enabled me to discover my voice and express it to others.

It has always been my quest for survival as well as for discovering the beauty in pain. I could go on forever about how deeply meaningful and profound poetry is to me and how it ignites a fire within me.

I implore everyone to give it a try by coming up with a topic to write about. You could write about anything that motivates and appeals to you! (It doesn't have to be about you or someone else; it may even be an inanimate object.)

You will eventually discover what motivates you, even if poetry doesn't speak to you the same way it does to me or other writers, you just have to look introspectively and find what works for you!
