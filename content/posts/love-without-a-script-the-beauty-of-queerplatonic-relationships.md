New Delhi: Certain relationships don’t quite have a name, a proper label, do they? But you feel them right in your chest. That bond is like no other. It’s the person you text before anyone else, whether it’s good news or bad – the one who knows your coffee order by heart and your deepest fears. The one you’ve never kissed, never gone out with – but you’re always chatting about getting a cat or a dog together. You’re perfectly in sync: she’s the eye makeup girl, you’re the lip girl. Every time there’s a queer event, you’re each other’s automatic plus-one. 

People ask if you’re in a relationship, and you laugh – not because it’s funny, but because it’s just not that simple, is it?

**What Exactly is a Queerplatonic Relationship?**

Within queer and ace communities, there’s a word for this sort of connection: a queerplatonic relationship, or QPR for short. It’s a bond that can look like a deep friendship, chosen family, or even a proper life partnership, minus the romance. It doesn’t quite fit into any of the usual boxes, and perhaps that’s the whole point.

Queerplatonic relationships go beyond your typical labels. They involve people who might identify as asexual, aromantic, or neither because QPRS aren’t defined by who you’re attracted to but by what you intend the relationship to be. These relationships put deep emotional intimacy front and centre and often share characteristics with romantic relationships: affection, commitment, even living together or planning a future. But the bond itself defies easy categorisation. It’s a relationship built on trust, care, and a deliberate closeness – a kind of love that simply refuses to be put in a box.

The term ‘queerplatonic relationship’ was coined out of necessity – to help define relationships that felt like more than just being good friends, but without the traditional romantic and sexual intimacy. It gave people a word, a language, to describe something they’d always felt but couldn’t quite put their finger on, owing to the lack of queer-friendly terminology.

**What Do Queerplatonic Relationships Look Like Day to Day?**

QPRS tend to exist in that in-between space. They reject the old-fashioned notion that intimacy must be romantic or sexual, instead building themselves around care, loyalty, and deep emotional connection. Sometimes QPRS involve a bit of physical affection, but that’s not always the case. Some queerplatonic partners live together, raise pets, or share their finances. Others might live apart but remain each other’s emotional anchor – the go-to person, the constant, the one you don’t need to explain yourself to.

**Why Do QPRS Matter?**

Queerplatonic relationships challenge the very blueprint of what we think of as love. They challenge the ingrained belief that romantic relationships are the be-all and end-all, the most important kind of relationship. In a world shaped by amatonormativity (the assumption that romantic relationships are the most significant) and heteronormativity (the belief that heterosexuality is the default and that romantic and sexual relationships should be between a man and a woman), QPRS serve as a proper reminder that there are other ways to build a life, love, be loved, and matter deeply to someone without fitting into a pre-determined mould.

For many queer folks, particularly those who are asexual or aromantic, QPRS offer a form of connection that doesn’t require them to fit into traditional, often restrictive, heteronormative scripts. But QPRS aren’t just for ace or aro people. Anyone can be in a QPR. What truly defines it isn’t who you are but what you intend the relationship to be – the conscious choice to be in a deep, committed, non-romantic, or non-traditional partnership.

**Why They’re Especially Important for Queer People**

For queer people, chosen family is often a crucial support system, and QPRS offer them stability, tenderness, and a sense of belonging in a world that often withholds those things unless you’re part of a romantic couple. They’re proof that love doesn’t have to follow a set script to be genuine, valid, or profoundly deep.

**The Sheer Variety of Queerplatonic Relationships**

QPRS don’t follow a one-size-fits-all approach and are incredibly diverse. Some might include romantic elements but aren’t fundamentally romantic; some might have romantic gestures or feelings but choose not to go down the traditional romantic path of dating.

Here are a few examples of QPRS to give you a better idea:

* Committed co-parents or pet-parents where there’s no romance involved.
* Friends who consciously choose to be life partners, sharing a home and planning for the future together.
* A deep emotional bond that includes platonic physical affection, like cuddling for comfort.
* Incredibly close friends who prioritise their bond in the way others might prioritise a romantic partnership.
* A stable, primary source of support that exists outside of any romantic or sexual relationships.

**Thinking Outside the Box of Love**

Ultimately, queerplatonic relationships highlight that love and deep connection can flourish in ways that go beyond traditional societal expectations. They demonstrate the validity and profound significance of relationships built on intention, care, and a commitment that simply refuses to be confined by outdated categories.
