New Delhi: I have loved dogs since I was a child, and despite having a pet dog, I have always felt devoted to the dogs in my colony. Instead of changing my uniform when I got home from school, I would hurriedly pack bread, biscuits, and milk and rush to the park behind my house to feed the pups that lived right outside the park.

I had named each of them and loved them as much as I loved my dog, which is why it crushed my heart to learn that the one I was closest to had been poisoned. I was too young to grasp why somebody would do such a thing, but now I am old enough to understand how people treat indies.

I didn't know or comprehend the horrors of life back then, as well as I do now, and I wish there was something I could do about it. Seeing puppies live on the side of the road enrages and distresses me because they do not deserve to live in such a harsh environment; they require safe and loving homes.

Indie dogs live in the toughest conditions and are subjected to maltreatment daily. They live on the streets instead of in a safe place because people are terrified of them and they either try to hurt them or call someone to take them away.

According to my observations, indie dogs typically attack only when provoked. Even if they do lash out, it is exclusively as a result of the brutality and abuse they have been subjected to regularly.

The majority of India's street dogs survive by scavenging garbage and living in filthy surroundings. It is quite perilous for them to live on the streets since they frequently fall into manholes or get hit by cars.

Across the country, dozens of animal care organisations work tirelessly to feed and rehabilitate homeless dogs. Due to their fear and ignorance of the evils of breeding and the bias of purebred dogs, many Indian citizens perceive these wonderful sentient beings as things and nuisances that need to be eradicated rather than as equals and living beings.

Some individuals even try to get rid of street dogs by using terrible means like poisoning and beatings, which makes me question how people can have so much hatred for someone that hasn't done anything to them.

Even after living in horrifying conditions, these beautiful beings are still full of love and joy. They're so pure that every time you go to meet them, they will follow you around, give you kisses, and try to play with you.

Last month, I went for a walk with my cousins, and on my way home, I discovered three puppies on the road, so I immediately called a friend and told her about them, hoping to find a home for them.

I had to leave them there, as much as I didn't want to. I went to see those puppies today, a month later, and although they have a tent where they sleep at night and are well fed every day, the state of the place where they reside pained me and made me want to take them home. But, I can't as I already have a dog. Seeing them today, filled my heart with insurmountable love.

People are afraid of getting bitten by street dogs. Throughout my experience, though, I have been bitten by two pet dogs and one street dog in my entire life. I was about 11 or 12 years old when I was bitten by a dog while attempting to play with him. He grabbed my hand with his mouth and wouldn't let go until the owner forced him to.

He was a one-or two-year-old German shepherd who resided above my parents' shop. My brother agitated my dog and encouraged her to bite me, and that was the second time I was bitten by a dog.

The second time was when my 4-and-a-half-year-old female German Shepard bit me as she is extremely possessive of my brother, which is what prompted her to bite me. In my opinion, dogs do not bite unless provoked or out of fear and self-preservation.

The third time I was bitten by a dog, it was by an indie who was 3 years old. He had just awoken, and when I bent down to speak to him, he grabbed my leg. I remained calm while my family was terrified. I assumed he bit me because he felt I was about to hurt him or because he caught my dog's scent. You'd think that after being bitten by dogs several times, I'd develop a phobia of them, but it merely taught me "why" dogs might attack us.

My dog was in an accident in 2020, and her spinal cord broke and overlapped. Many people advised us to put her down, but we refused, and she survived. She has muscle atrophy, but every day she attempts to stand up and walk or move her tail, and those little movements make me smile and make me fall further in love with her. The indie that bit me last year had an accident and was in a similar position as she was; he has now fully recovered. Hearing this gave me a sense of relief and made me glad that he is doing well. I love indies as much as I love purebred dogs. There is no comparison between the two in my mind. However, the fact that purebreds have the privilege of a home that most indies don't, remains unchanged and ever-present.

I urge you to look at indies the same way you look at purebred dogs. They may live in an unsanitary environment, but that is only because it is nearly impossible for them to be adopted. In the last three years, my friends and I have rescued, fostered, and assisted in the adoption of numerous dogs, and there is always another dog or litter of puppies in need of a home.

Please assist us in spreading love rather than hatred for these wonderful beings. I respectfully ask that you treat them equally and with dignity. They are not insignificant or unpleasant; they are lovely, full of love, pure, and, most importantly, sentient beings who deserve to be treated as such.
