New Delhi: As someone who has lived with panic and anxiety for most of her life, I felt it was finally time to write about it. I’ve experienced panic attacks and chest-aching anxiety for as long as I can remember, but I didn’t fully understand what they were—or how to differentiate between the two—until high school. I often talk about how these episodes affect my day-to-day life, how they make certain situations feel heavier, harder. But I’ve never written about it. Until now.

The older I get, the more I realise how important it is to talk about mental health openly and personally. My experience might not reflect everyone else’s, but if it helps even one person feel less alone, that’s enough. Vulnerability is terrifying—but I choose it. Because while my mental health doesn’t define me, it shapes me in ways I can’t ignore.

My interest in creating awareness started at home. Anxiety and panic have been with me for so long; they’ve become part of my story. And while people may expect me to hide it or feel ashamed, I won’t. Not anymore.

The rest of this article will be grounded in facts, but I wanted to begin here, with the truth.

### An Overview of Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions that cause a person to respond to certain situations or thoughts with intense fear, worry, or dread. These responses aren’t just emotional—they also come with physical symptoms such as a racing heart, shortness of breath, restlessness, and sweating.

While it’s completely natural to feel anxious before a big event like a job interview, an exam, or making a tough decision, that kind of anxiety is part of being human. An anxiety disorder, however, goes beyond that everyday nervousness. The anxiety becomes persistent and overwhelming and begins to interfere with your ability to function in daily life.

There are several types of anxiety disorders—including Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and phobia-related disorders—but they all share a common thread: the anxiety feels constant or easily triggered, and it’s difficult to control.

Living with an anxiety disorder can make even ordinary tasks feel exhausting. It can affect how you think, feel, and act—and when left untreated, it can deeply impact your overall well-being.

### An Overview of Panic Disorder

Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder marked by multiple, unexpected panic attacks. These are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes. Panic attacks often occur without warning, and they aren't caused by another physical or mental health condition. In many cases, there’s no specific trigger—you could be going about your day normally, and the wave just hits.

The experience can be so overwhelming that it feels like something is seriously wrong, even if there's no real danger. During a panic attack, you might feel like you can’t breathe, your heart is racing out of control, your chest may ache or tighten, and you might feel dizzy, detached from reality, or on the verge of losing control entirely.

What separates panic disorder from isolated panic attacks is the ongoing fear of having another one. People with panic disorder often live in anticipation of the next episode, worrying about where or when it might strike. This can lead to avoiding certain places, people, or situations, sometimes to the point of social withdrawal, just to feel “safe”.

That said, it’s also important to note: not everyone who experiences a panic attack develops panic disorder. Panic attacks can happen independently, even once or twice in a lifetime, without turning into a recurring condition.

## Panic Attacks vs. Anxiety Attacks: Key Differences

### Impact

* Panic Attacks: Extremely disruptive, often sudden and marked by intense physical symptoms.
* Anxiety Attacks: Also disruptive, but may range from mild to severe. They tend to build up gradually and are generally less intense, but can still significantly impair day-to-day functioning.

##### **S﻿ymptoms**

***Panic Attack Symptoms***

* Excessive sweating
* Heart palpitations
* Trembling or shaking
* Nausea or abdominal pain
* Numbness or tingling sensations
* Chills or hot flashes
* Feeling detached from reality (derealisation)

#### Conclusion

Understanding the difference between panic attacks and anxiety attacks isn’t just about definitions; it’s about recognising what your body and mind are trying to tell you. For years, I didn’t know there was a difference. I just knew something felt wrong, and I didn’t have the words to explain it. Learning the language of my mental health—naming it, understanding it—was one of the first steps toward healing.

Whether you’ve experienced one panic attack or live with chronic anxiety, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. What you feel is real, and it matters. The more we talk about mental health, the more we break down shame and misinformation. The more we share, the less alone someone else might feel in their struggle.

Panic and anxiety may still be a part of my life, but now, I face them with knowledge, self-compassion, and the awareness that it’s okay to ask for help. That it’s okay to pause. That it’s okay to feel.
