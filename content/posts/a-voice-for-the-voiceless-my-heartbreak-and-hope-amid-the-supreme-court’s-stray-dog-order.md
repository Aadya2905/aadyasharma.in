**New Delhi:** I have been anxiously signing and sharing petitions, creating reels, and posting Instagram stories to raise awareness about the Supreme Court’s order regarding stray dogs. For those who don’t know, on **August 11, 2025**, the Supreme Court, through a **suo motu** action, ordered the permanent removal of stray dogs from **Delhi–NCR** public spaces—mandating sheltering, sterilisation, and no release back to the streets—citing public safety as a priority.

And now, there’s an update: the Court has referred the case to a **three-judge bench** and is scheduled to pronounce its order **tomorrow, Friday, 22nd August,** on the pleas seeking a stay on the **August 11 directions.**

## **Why This Feels So Personal**

As a dog mom and someone who has been around dogs her entire life, this decision shook me to my core. My childhood was filled with moments of rushing home from school, quickly mixing milk and bread, and packing them into containers to feed the puppies that lived behind my house.

I’ll never forget the first set of puppies I cared for—the way I tucked one inside my jacket to protect them from the rain, running towards the parking lot with my dog’s old bed alongside my elder brother for the ambassador car that had become their home, even breaking my first phone to protect one of them from harm.

And my first loss—I’ll never forget that either. I still remember coming home from school, excited to see my favourite puppy, only to hear from the guard bhaiya that someone had poisoned her food earlier that day. She didn’t make it.

## **The Cruelty Doesn’t Stop**

The cruelty, the indifference—it never ends.

Five years ago, I took my dog Kiara for a walk. I had let her off the leash in the dog park, and I’ll never forget the way she ran out of the park to follow my friend and her sister, who were taking their dog—also Kiara’s best friend—for a walk. That moment led to a hit-and-run. The driver didn’t stop. He hit her not once, not twice, but three times.

For that reason, my dog can’t walk anymore. She’s paraplegic, with no bladder control, and her favourite thing in the world—park time—was stolen from her.

Kiara is not an indie dog, nor is she a rescue, and you might wonder why this is relevant. It’s relevant because even as a pet dog, she faced the same fate that so many indie dogs have been forced to face their whole lives. That’s the point of this. That’s the relevance of Kiara’s story. Because if this can happen to a pet dog, what do you think happens to the indie dogs?

Recently, on Holi, I got a call from my friend telling me that our beloved Marley, who was just a few months old, had become the victim of another hit-and-run. Because there were no external injuries, they couldn’t tell if anything was wrong until it was too late—and due to internal bleeding, we lost her. To me, it felt like someone had ripped my heart out of my chest and crushed it.

Every Diwali, we live in fear that we might lose one of our colony dogs because they’re terrified of crackers. I see dog lovers coming together, opening their homes to protect them, but throughout the year, I feel so much anger and sadness for our community dogs.

They don’t deserve this—they don’t deserve the cruelty the world has bestowed upon them.

It breaks my heart that I live with this constant fear of losing one of them. They may not live with me, but I love them with all my heart. They are my best friends, my home, and my go-to confidants on days when life feels too overwhelming to be around people and when being alone feels like loneliness.

These dogs have never failed to put a smile on my face, lick away my tears, or make me laugh hysterically after a complete meltdown in front of them. They’ve never failed to make me feel protected on my walks.

They always have been, and always will be, my home.

## **The Heart of Rescue Work**

I have seen the time, effort, care, and financial resources rescuers and animal activists put into looking after these dogs—providing sterilisation, vaccinations, vet visits, ambulances, para-vets, food, and water, and taking turns to feed them.

Even when a dog lover hasn’t adopted an indie dog, I’ve seen rescuers pour themselves into caring for our community dogs. I’ve seen my friend covered in puppy vomit and poop; I’ve seen her go above and beyond for these little angels.

Two years ago, one of our community dogs got pregnant. To take care of her, a group of people fought against all odds to create a home for her—a safe space to give birth.

That’s how our Spice Pups came into this world: in a shelter full of love and care. Blacku, or Jamun—the mother—was treated like a pet dog, fed, and cared for by people who took turns making her comfortable for birth.

There were regular updates about the babies—nine of them. I witnessed two of them being born. From the moment they came into this world, this whole community stepped in.

As much as I love dogs and try to do my best, it’s seeing this kind of compassion that inspires me to speak up more often. It gives me the courage to use my voice.

This group of people took care of everything. There was a time when one of the puppies, Rosemary, was unwell and might not have survived, but I saw them nurse her back to health and find her the most loving forever home.

## **The Grim Reality of the Order**

Now, as people talk about the permanent removal of street dogs, animal welfare activists and dog lovers are trying to give a reality check: to show what will happen if the SC’s order is executed.

There are no shelters that can take in more dogs. New shelters will realistically never be built in just eight weeks—we don’t have the resources. The existing shelters have been overcrowded and underfunded for years.

Every day, I see posts asking for crowdfunding to help a dog in need. Every day, I see food fundraisers and Amazon wishlists.

If it were that simple, rescuers wouldn’t be paying from their own pockets to save dogs’ lives every single day. They wouldn’t be running to get community dogs sterilised or fighting with dog-haters daily just to let the dogs live.

These dogs were born here. This is their home. Haven’t they suffered enough?

When life didn’t give them a real home or shelter, they learnt to live on the streets and make it theirs—and now even that is being taken away.

Newborn puppies won’t survive this. We don’t even know under what conditions they’ll be taken in, let alone where. Wherever they end up will be overcrowded—thousands of anxious dogs in one space. Everyone will be on edge, in survival mode.

They’ll be confused, anxious, displaced—forced out of their home into an unknown space.

And what about dogs with physical disabilities? Senior dogs? How are they expected to endure this?

Some of these dogs are used to regular meals because of established feeding systems. Who will feed them now, and when?

Some have never scavenged for meals—this will create anxiety and food aggression. Disabled dogs will be neglected. Who knows how they’ll be cared for—or if they’ll even be cared for at all?

It’s already incredibly difficult to care for a disabled dog because of the time, attention, and financial resources required. So what’s next? What will happen then?

## **How I’m Feeling—and Why I’m Speaking Up**

It feels as though there are a thousand questions and very few answers. I don’t know what to expect or what to think. All I know is that ever since I read the news, I’ve been anxious, restless, and hurting. I feel angry and helpless. I want to create change. I want to use my voice. I want to share my feelings and my thoughts—because this is personal, and it is political.

## **What You Can Do**

* **Sign petitions** pushing for humane, realistic solutions
* **Share verified information** to raise awareness.
* **Support rescuers and shelters**—through donations, supplies, or volunteer time.
* **Use your voice**—advocate for animals who cannot speak for themselves.

**This isn’t just a story. It’s a call to action. And these dogs—they deserve to be heard.**
