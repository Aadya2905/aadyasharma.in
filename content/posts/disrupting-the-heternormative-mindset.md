Gender has been a concept since the dawn of time. The purpose of this article is to challenge societal gender norms and to unlearn the preexisting heteronormative thinking regarding gender. An essay that one of my close friends wrote served as the basis for this piece. Reading her essay gave me the inspiration I needed to finally write about this. 

We've been taught that gender and sex are inseparably linked; that they go hand in hand or are the same, but what if I told you that they're not? What if I told you that gender and sex are not indissolubly related, that they are distinct concepts? We frequently hear that “gender is socially constructed.” What does that mean? Is it true?

Sex is what we are assigned at birth, whereas gender is a social construct made up by society itself, thus assigning and enforcing gender roles and spreading the myth that gender is binary.

 Between "sex" and "gender," there is a distinction. Gender is "psychological," "social," or "cultural," whereas sex is "biological" and is determined at birth. The gender and sex of a person might be distinct from one another. 

People who identify with the sex they were given at birth are known as cisgender. There are several gender identities other than male or female. There are various gender identities such as non-binary, agender, genderfluid, queer, gender non-conforming, etc.

Never assume someone's gender by the way they appear, act, or dress. Researching and educating ourselves, switching to gender-neutral pronouns, asking others for their pronouns when we meet them, and introducing oneself using their pronouns are steps that one can take to be a better ally and to unlearn the archaic concepts we've been taught about gender. Another way to be a good ally is to add your pronouns in your email signature.

 Misgendering and assuming someone's gender can be hurtful and cause that person to feel disrespected, invalidated, ignored, isolated, or dysphoric. In order to avoid offending anyone, we should learn how to use gender-neutral pronouns and always ask for someone's pronouns when we first meet them. In the end, you don't want to infer something about someone's gender that is inaccurate or hurtful. 

Just because someone appears feminine or masculine doesn't mean they are a man or woman — they could be agender, nonbinary, or uncomfortable identifying with "he" or "she".

How to ask someone what pronouns they use?

Try asking: What pronouns do you use? or "Could you just remind me of your pronouns?" Although it may feel awkward at first, it is far less awkward than making a hurtful assumption.

To avoid misgendering someone, it's necessary to find out their pronouns. Asking everyone you meet and interact with about their pronouns can make it more acceptable and secure for people to reveal their pronouns, which they may not have been able to do in the past. 

What are Gender Neutral / Gender Inclusive Pronouns?

Pronouns that are gender-neutral do not indicate whether the sentence's subject is male or female. For instance, the third-person pronoun "they" is gender-neutral. The pronouns "them," "this person," "everyone," "Ze," and "hir" are also gender-neutral." You can also use that person's name if you're unsure about which pronoun to use. Most likely, you have no idea what they are or even how to utilise them. You may make sure your phrases are inclusive for everyone by utilising terminology that is gender-neutral. 

So, here’s a list of gender-neutral pronouns:

* He/She-Zie, Sie, Ey, Ve, Tey, E
* Him/Her-Zim, Sie, Em, Ver, Ter, Em
* His/Her-Zir, Hir, Eir, Vis, Tem, Eir
* His/Hers-Zis, Hirs, Eirs, Vers, Ters, Eirs
* Himself/Herself-Zieself, Hirself, Eirself, Verself, Terself, Emsel

However, there are more traditional gender-neutral pronouns you can introduce into your everyday conversation, regardless of the individual. These include "them," "they," "their," "everyone," and "that person".

When in doubt, refer to someone by their name, rather than "him" or "her".

Additionally, it's acceptable if you ever use the wrong pronouns for someone.  Everybody makes mistakes occasionally. The best course of action when using the incorrect pronouns for someone is to be aware of the impact, apologise, follow up in private if necessary, and keep in mind that the goal is to find ways to support the person you may have unintentionally disrespected and hurt, not to make yourself feel better. 

As you express your goals to use their pronouns correctly, ask them if they need anything more from you. Make a commitment to changing your behaviour. To change the language you use, practising someone's pronouns aloud in a quiet situation is a useful tactic. Move ahead. Focus on the reasons why it's crucial to use the correct pronouns and names instead of your bad habits if you want to change them. 

Additionally, if you mistakenly identify someone, they might prefer some distance from you. Respect their needs and pledge to uphold the inclusive behaviours you value.
