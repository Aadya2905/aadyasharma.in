 New Delhi: The arrival of Valentine's Week often brings a flurry of activity: whispers exchanged, plans poked and prodded,all hoping to share a juicy tidbit. Some relish the gossip, from romantic dinner plans to awkward colleague inquiries. But for me, it can feel intrusive, particularly when personal boundaries are overstepped, especially in the workplace.

This year, amidst the gifts of flowers and chocolates from friends, a colleague's question about my dating life made me uncomfortable. It wasn't just the discomfort of sharing personal life details with someone I barely knew. It was the assumption of my sexuality and the intrusion into a private aspect of my life at work.

But that's just one facet of Valentine's Day. Why is it so heavily associated with romantic love? Don't all forms of love deserve equal recognition and celebration?

For me, Valentine's Day shines brightest when it celebrates love beyond romance. The joy of my friend's surprise ramen after a tough day, the genuine pleasure of receiving flowers froma new friend or my best friend's mom—these moments resonated with me deeply.

This year, I spent the week doing things I love, celebrating my relationship with myself, and being enraptured by platonic love. Homecooked meals, thoughtful gifts, and time spent with friends I hadn't met in a while were the perfect antidotes to a stressful week. It filled me with gratitude and reinforced the importance of non-romantic connections.

I also observed different perspectives. My supervisor, newly married, didn't see Valentine's Day as any different from any other. It was a refreshing reminder that this day doesn't hold the same significance for everyone.

While grand gestures and romantic celebrations have their place, let's celebrate all forms of love equally. Platonic friendships, self-care, and familial bonds deserve equal recognition on Valentine's Day and every other day.
